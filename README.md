# LFGSS Mobile

You've found the Flutter codebase for the (unofficial) LFGSS Mobile app.

If you'd like to help, there's a poorly maintained list of issues
[here](https://github.com/cyclotron3k/lfgss_mobile/issues). You may want to ask
clarifying questions before getting started though.

## Context

Although Flutter is cross-platform. Only an Android version has been released
so far. With a little work, an iOS version could be produced. Furthermore, I've
tried to minimise LFGSS specific code, so it shouldn't be too much work to
produce clients for other sites on the Microcosm platform.

## TBD

- Firebase & push notifications
- Separate conversation download and read pointer updates
- Mobile notification preferences into API
- Convert Polls (& Lists, and Events?) from Item to Attachment?
- https://blurha.sh/ for images
- TZ calcs on event timestamps
